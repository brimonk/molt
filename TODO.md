# TODO

to do list before we can write the thesis

## Completed

* make it easy to run the program a whole shitload of times

## Remaining

* find a way to easily compare all of them
* ensure serial + parallel (cpu) and parallel (gpu) implementations match
* add windows threaded
* include timestamps in output (its own lump, I think)
